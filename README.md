# Trybers & Dragons

Trybers & Dragons is a project developed as part of the "Trybe" course to simulate the famous tabletop RPG game "Dungeons & Dragons." The project aims to create object-oriented programming classes to represent races, archetypes, monsters, and many other RPG elements. It also applies classes that develop the combat system for player vs player (PVP) and player vs environment (PVE).

## Features

The project includes the following features:

- **Character creation**: players can create and customize their own characters, choosing race, class, abilities, and characteristics.
- **Adventure exploration**: characters can engage in various adventures, with different scenarios and challenges to face.
- **Interaction with the world**: players can interact with the game world, talk to NPCs (non-playable characters), find items, and make decisions that affect the development of the story.

## Technologies Used

The project was developed using the following technologies:

- **Typescript**
- **POO (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Javascript**
- **Node**

## Key Learnings

The main learning was the use of SOLID principles for object-oriented programming (OOP), aiming for better organization and applying clean code practices for future refactoring. Another important lesson was the use of OOP itself, where I first used classes, applying the four pillars of OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism), as well as utilizing instances, methods, and attributes.

## Conclusion

The Trybers & Dragons project offers players an interactive experience in the world of tabletop RPG, allowing for character creation, battles against monsters and dragons, and player vs player battles.
